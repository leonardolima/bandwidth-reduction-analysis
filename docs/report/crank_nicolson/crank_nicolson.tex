<h3>Solving the 1D Heat Equation</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let's consider the following initial boundary value problem:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
$$ 
  \left\{
  \begin{cases}
  \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}, & (x,t)\in\]0,1\[\times\]0,T\] \\
  u(0,t) = u(1,t) = 0, & t\in\[0,T\] \\
  u(x,0) = 2x, & x\in\[0,1\]
  \end{cases}
$$

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since this is a continuous problem, in order to solve it computationally, we need to discretize it. Let's first define a computational grid, or mesh, $(x(i), t(m)$, where $x(i) = ih, 0 \leq i \leq N$. We define $N = \frac{1}{h}$, where $h$ is the mesh spacing in the $x$ direction. Similarly, we define $t(m) = mk$, where $k$ is the time step. Considering the continuous function $u(x,t)$, its correspondent discretized version is approximated by computing it at $u(x(i), t(m))$, denoted by $U(i,m)$ from now on.</p>

<p>The next step is to discretize the governing equation. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:html -->
$$ \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} \approx \frac{u(x(i), t(m)) - u(x(i)-h, t(m))}{h} \approx \frac{U(i,m)-U(i-1,m)}{h} $$
